## Introduction
Welcome to Flix Critique, a sophisticated Movie Recommendation System developed as a group coursework project for the CM1605 Web Technology module at the Informatics Institute of Technology, Department of Computing. Flix Critique aims to simplify the daunting task of choosing a movie by offering personalized recommendations, movie reviews, and a platform for purchasing movie-related products.

## Features
- Personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences.
- Movie reviewing feature.
- Platform for purchasing movie-related products.
- Favorite list creation for past watched movies.
- Gallery page showcasing latest releases, top picks, and most watched movies.
- Engaging movie quizzes.
- User feedback mechanism for system refinement.

## Research on existing systems
We conducted research on existing movie-related websites such as IMDb and Letterboxd to understand their features and user experiences. While IMDb offers comprehensive details including cast, crew, and polls, Letterboxd focuses more on social interaction and user-generated lists. Flix Critique combines elements from both platforms to create a modern and user-friendly movie browsing experience.

## Technical Implementation
- Animated navigation bar using JavaScript.
- Theme change option (light/dark) implemented with JavaScript and CSS.
- Slider showcasing movie banners with CSS elements.
- Background video element for enhanced visual appeal.
- Personalized movie recommendations utilizing local storage API.
- User feedback form with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Interactive movie quiz using JavaScript's prompt() function.

## Discussion of UX/UI Principles
- Navigation Techniques: Clear and descriptive navigation links enhance user experience.
- Color Balance/Selection/Consistency: Implemented light and dark theme options for user customization.
- Typography/Consistency: Ensured consistency in font styles and sizes throughout the website.
- Accessibility: Form validation and color contrast tests were performed to enhance accessibility.
