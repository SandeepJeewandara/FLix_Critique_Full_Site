## Research on existing systems
We conducted research on existing movie-related websites such as IMDb and Letterboxd to understand their features and user experiences. While IMDb offers comprehensive details including cast, crew, and polls, Letterboxd focuses more on social interaction and user-generated lists. Flix Critique combines elements from both platforms to create a modern and user-friendly movie browsing experience.

## Technical Implementation
- Animated navigation bar using JavaScript.
- Theme change option (light/dark) implemented with JavaScript and CSS.
- Slider showcasing movie banners with CSS elements.
- Background video element for enhanced visual appeal.
- Personalized movie recommendations utilizing local storage API.
- User feedback form with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- Interactive movie quiz using JavaScript's prompt() function.

## Discussion of UX/UI Principles
- Navigation Techniques: Clear and descriptive navigation links enhance user experience.
- Color Balance/Selection/Consistency: Implemented light and dark theme options for user customization.
